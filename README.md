This is my submission for the code challenge from Insight Data Engineering Program.

In my src folder, there's a single .py file called purchase_analytics.py that contains all my codes needed to complete this challenge. The only library I used is the python build-in library **csv**.

I have included 4 tests in my unit testing. Test_1 is provided in your original github repo, in test_2 I added up the order_products.csv and used the whole products.csv as input, test_3 has the input of order_products_train.csv and products.csv, and test_4 has the input of order_products_prior.csv and products.csv.

However github doesn't allow me to upload the input files for test_4 because it exceeds their limit size, so you can only see 3 tests in my repo. But test_4 does pass on my computer, it just took a few minutes (3 min on my laptop) to complete. Please please be patient, it will pass...
